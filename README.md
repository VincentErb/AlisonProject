# AlisonProject

## Work on the project

If you have no IDE to manage the project, you can still install some tools to help you.

First, if you don't have it, install `virtualenv`

```
pip3 install virtualenv
```

Running the script `scripts/init.sh` will then setup virtualenv and install all the requirements for the project.

Then you can use `scripts/format.sh` to format the whole project, and `pylint alison` to spot errors and bad practices in your code.
