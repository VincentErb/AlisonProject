# Resources and Libraries

This project uses libraries to help with sound processing and signal analysis, mostly for NMF (Non-Negative-Matrix-Factorization).

## Respeaker

The Respeaker Project is a sound processing peripheral for Raspberry Pi. Hardware-wise, it comprises 4 microphones allowing for sound source localization. Software-wise, it helps with sound encoding and processing (it also provides advanced features like speech recognition that are not used in this project).

We used the Respeaker to record .WAV files for new sound registering, and real time audio recording for the recognition process.
