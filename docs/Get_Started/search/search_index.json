Installation The app isn't available on the Google Play Store yet. Simply download the apk from our website and that's it ! You're now ready to use the Alison System ! Using the app to record sounds With the Raspberry Pi set-up and connected, get into the companion app and start recording sounds that you want to recognize, and associating a color with each sound. The system is now fully operational ! It will detect sounds in real time, and you can add or remove a given sound any time using the app.","title":"Hardware requirements"},{"location":"#hardware-requirements","text":"The Alison System requires three main hardware components to function : An android phone with Android version 5.0 Lollipop or later A Philips Hue system with multi-color lightbulb (both lightbulb AND bridge) A Raspberry Pi 3B+ (other versions may be functional but have not yet been tested)","title":"Hardware requirements"},{"location":"#raspberry-pi-software-installation","text":"","title":"Raspberry Pi Software Installation"},{"location":"#prerequisites","text":"Your Raspberry Pi must run the latest version of Raspbian available.
